### Set of helper functions to easily extract outcomes information from LAYC database

### TO DO
* Modify id_prepost() to move id & date as a function argument
* review ged_gains(): Probably too complex, and many assumptions built in. Additionnally, duplicates need to be removed.
* review ALL GED functions to take into account the new GED format
* review ged_gains() and jrt_gains() their outputs should be formatted the same way.
